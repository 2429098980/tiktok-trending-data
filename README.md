### `Disabled because TikTok now has captchas preventing collection of open trending data`

This repo scrapes TikToks Web API automatically using GitHub Actions and monitors changes to its discovery endpoint on 3 different subdomains.

All pages are downloaded as JSON and prettyfied with jq. A commit is made whenever a change is detected and all changes can be viewed throughout the commit history.


## Inspiration: 
 - [Git scraping: track changes over time by scraping to a Git repository by Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/)
 - [California fire data history](https://github.com/simonw/ca-fires-history)

## Improvements: 
 - ignore covers or just remove signature from their urls. Its not constant
